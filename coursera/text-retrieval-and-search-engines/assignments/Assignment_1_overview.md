# Overview

For the programming assignments, you are going to use [MeTA](https://meta-toolkit.github.io/meta/), a C++ data sciences toolkit that supports a variety of tasks such as text retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning. The main focus in this course will be on how to use and extend the text retrieval methods implemented in MeTA. The assignments assume a very basic understanding of C++ and elementary data structures. That being said, even if your experience is in languages other than C++, you are highly encouraged to go through the assignments, as the focus will be on exploring text retrieval concepts, not on testing your knowledge of the syntax.

This assignment will explore the main text processing techniques implemented in MeTA and then guide you through implementing a major component of a search engine. It will also involve a competition where you can freely create and optimize your own search engine. Although the assignment starts in Week 3, we encourage you to install the toolkit as soon as possible.

If you have questions about the installation process, use the [Programming Assignments Forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/text-retrieval/group/pvMMvRhSEeaIJBLsrsqR1Q/discussions/). This is a great place to ask questions and also help your fellow classmates.


## Software Installation

There are two software prerequisites you must install in order to complete the assignments:

    MeTA
    Python 2.7 (used only for uploading your assignment, not for coding)

To install the MeTA tool, please follow this [page](https://meta-toolkit.org/setup-guide.html#windows-build-guide). Currently, most major OS including OS X, Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions), and Windows are supported.
